/**
 Below we will define an n-interesting polygon. Your task is to find the area of a polygon for a given n.

 A 1-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length 1.
 An n-interesting polygon is obtained by taking the n - 1-interesting polygon and appending 1-interesting polygons to its rim,
 side by side. You can see the 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-interesting polygons in the picture below.



 Example

 For n = 2, the output should be
 shapeArea(n) = 5;
 For n = 3, the output should be
 shapeArea(n) = 13.
 Input/Output

 [time limit] 3000ms (java)
 [input] integer n

 Constraints:
 1 â‰¤ n < 104.

 [output] integer

 The area of the n-interesting polygon.
